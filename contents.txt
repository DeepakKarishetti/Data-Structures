	- Performance of algorithms and data structure operations.

Data structures:

 - Linked list
	 - It is a linear data structure like arrays but not stored at contiguous locations.
	 - The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers. 
	 - Linked list structure consists of node objects and each node consists of one data value. Each node contains a pointer to the next node, and nodes can be independently created or destroyed.

	 - Applications:
		 - Low level data structure for implementing - stacks and queues.
		 - Linear contained for use when lots of cutting/splicing operations are important
		 - Keeping track of undo chains
		 - Other data structures - hashtables and graphs
